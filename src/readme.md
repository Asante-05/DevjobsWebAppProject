- Designing and implementing responsive layouts for various screen sizes.
- Incorporating hover states for interactive elements to enhance user experience.
- Implementing filters for job title, location, and full-time positions on the index page.
- Providing detailed job information on a separate page and allowing users to apply for jobs directly.
